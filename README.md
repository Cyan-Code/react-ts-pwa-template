# React TypeScript PWA Template

This repository provides a base template to create a PWA with the following capabilities:

- Custom logo.
- Custom splash screen.
- Install prompt (only for Chrome and Android devices).
- Simple way to handle updates in the code from a service worker.

You could try this template running from the cli:

```
yarn install
yarn serve
```

After that, go to `http://localhost:3000` in your Chrome browser.
